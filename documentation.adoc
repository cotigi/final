== Introduction

In this project we documented the network infrastructure 
of a package delivery company. Like https://gls-group.com/HU/hu/home/[GLS]
and https://www.foxpost.hu/[FOXPOST], this company delivers to 
package lockers.

There are three sites:

Headquarters:: This location is where the company handles acounting and development.
Office:: This location offers in person customer service and package pick up.
Package Center:: This location houses the packages and the company servers.
