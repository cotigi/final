== Introduction

In this project we documented the network infrastructure 
of a package delivery company. Like https://gls-group.com/HU/hu/home/[GLS]
and https://www.foxpost.hu/[FOXPOST], this company delivers to 
package lockers.

There are three sites:

Headquarters:: This location is where the company handles acounting and development.
Office:: This location offers in person customer service and package pick up.
Package Center:: This location houses the packages and the company servers.

== Project Management

=== Task Tracking
The task are tracked using https://trello.com/[Trello] with 
each task being assigned to one of three lists.

- *Todo*
- *In Progress*
- *Done*

The task naming convention is: *<category>: <topic>*

These categories are:

- *Documentation*
- *Network*
- *Linux server*
- *Windows server*

==== Automations

===== Labeling

- When a new task is created in the Todo list, this automation
labels the task depending on the category mentioned at the start
of the task name.

- When a task is dragged into the Done list the Done label
is automatically assigned.

===== miscellaneous

- When dragging a task from Todo to In Progress,
it automatically assigns the said person to the task.


=== Documentation
The documentation is written in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]
and converted into PDF. This document is stored on https://github.com/[Github]
for easier teamwork and version control.

Every addition to the documentation is a new branch that has the 
following naming convention:

- *Networking:* network/<site>/<topic>
- *Server:* server/<OS>/<topic>
- *Documentation:* docs/<topic>

When an addition is completed the person assigned to the task has to issue
a pull-request and the other party has to authorize it.
The main branch is protected and thus people can't push directly.

==== Github Actions

There is one workflow that is responsible for converting the 
Asciidoctor file to a PDF file for every branch on push and or pull requests.
This PDF file is uploaded as an artifact and can be downloaded in a zip file.
In the case of the main branch there is an additional feature 
that places the generated PDF file into the latest release.
